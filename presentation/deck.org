#+TITLE: Honeypot
#+STARTUP: content

* Honeypot
A simple experiment that:
- Creates a honeypot contract
- Baits a generalized fronturnning bot with a unique transaction
- Analyze bot behaviour using a black box approach

* Why generalized frontrunning bot?
- They are real
- They can frontrun even the most unknown protocols

* Why baiting?
- No public source code
- State of the art is constantly changing
- Indistinguishable from other bots on the surfaces

* Tech stack
- Solidity: dapptools
- Python: web3.py, pytest, pandas, etc
- Data sources: Alchemy and Etherscan

* Demo
- Contract code
- Contract tests
- Deployment
- My txs
- Bot txs
- Bot calldata
- Bot PnL

* Beyond the demo
- Calculate PnL based on EVM state changes
- Make the code generalizable and performing
- Find and study other bots
- Make an arbitrage bot
