#+STARTUP: content

* Honeypot
A simple experiment that:
- Creates a honeypot contract
- Baits a generalized fronturnning MEV bot with a unique transaction
- Analyze bot behaviour using a black box approach
  
* Why generalized frontrunning MEV bots?
- Dark forest
- Work on even the most unknown protocols
- Some even frontrun DeFi hacks

* Why baiting?
- State of the art is constantly changing
- No public source code
- Seemingly indistinguishable from other bots

* Tech stack
- Solidity: dapptools
- Python: web3.py, pytest, pandas, etc
- Data sources: Alchemy and Etherscan

* Demo
